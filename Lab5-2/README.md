This python script works with a file (sample.ini) and will output data into a text file called output.txt

Although This repo contains a file for the script to work with, any filepath can be specified when the script asks for it. It is recommended to place the script and input file in somewhere like C:\documents 

Be mindful that if output.txt already exists (say if the script was previously executed) it will be overwritten.
