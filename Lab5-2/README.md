This python script works with a file (sample.ini) and will output data into a text file called output.txt

Although This repo contains a file for the script to work with, any file can be specified when the script asks for it. It is required for the script and input file to be in the same directory.

Be mindful that if output file already exists (say if the script was previously executed) it will be overwritten.
