This python script works with a file (sample.ini) and will output data into a text file called output.txt

Although This repo contains a file for the script to work with, any file can be specified when the script asks for it. It is recommended to place the script and input file in the same directory so that only the filename has to be entered (and not an absolute path for a file buried deep within your file system)

Be mindful that if output file already exists (say if the script was previously executed) it will be overwritten.
